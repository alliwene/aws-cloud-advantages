* In its most basic definition, the cloud is a computer that is located somewhere else, accessed via the internet, and used in some way
* Also called web services
* The cloud comprises server computers in large data centers in different locations around the world. 
* Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources delivered through a cloud services platform via the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing
* Cloud computing has quickly become a key driving force for businesses today, as applications are moved out of on-premise data centers in an effort to innovate, reduce costs, and increase agility

* Increase speed and agility 
  
* Focus on your customers and your core business

Increase speed - cost and time that are needed to experiment and develop are much lower

Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers
